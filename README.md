**Notice:** This project has been initiated while learning Python 3 and the Django framework. The purpose of this project is purely for me the opportunity to learn coding and designing a web system and eventually to experience the challenges a full stack developper might face in its day job. It is still under development and all features are not completed yet! If you notice any coding error or security issue or if you have recommendations on design, coding or recommendations in general do not hesitate to contact me.
